## Melodic Meetups

Welcome to the Melodic Meetups project! This repository showcases a web application that consumes a given API to display detailed information about music artists, their tours, and more. The backend is built in Go, while the frontend offers a user-friendly interface for data visualization, enriched with interactive features.

### üõ† How It Works

Melodic Meetups is centered around receiving and manipulating a given API, which contains JSON structured data about music artists, their concerts, and relations between them. The goal of the project is to create an interactive website that visualizes this information in an engaging and user-friendly manner.
API Overview

The API provides data in four key parts:

    1. Artists: Contains band names, images, activity years, debut album dates, and member lists.
    2. Locations: Lists the locations of their concerts.
    3. Dates: Provides concert dates for each artist.
    4. Relations: Links artists to their concert dates and locations

With this data, the application creates multiple views, such as:

    Artist information, band name, and band members
    Concert date and location tables

### üöÄ Features

The web application comes packed with features that enhance user experience and functionality:
Data Visualizations

    i. Artist Profiles: View artist images, names, debut years, and member lists.
    ii. Concert Locations: Maps showing past and future concert venues.
    iii. Tour Dates: Interactive tables listing previous and upcoming concert dates.
    iv. Relation Mapping: Seamless integration of artists with their tour dates and locations.


#### User-Friendly UI

    Fully responsive design optimized for both desktop and mobile views.
    Clean navigation system that offers intuitive access to various data points.

#### Error Handling

    Robust handling of API request errors or missing data to ensure that the site never crashes.

## ‚ö° Events and Actions

An essential aspect of this project is the implementation of client-server interactions. A core feature is the event/action system, where the client triggers an event to fetch new data or perform a server-side action.

For example, when users select a specific artist, a client call is made to fetch related concert dates and locations. This request-response mechanism ensures dynamic content updating without requiring a full page reload.

The client-server interactions follow the Request-Response model. An event, such as clicking a button to view tour dates, triggers a server request, retrieves the relevant data, and updates the display.
   
## üíª Usage
#### Requirements

    Go 1.16+
    Access to the provided API (https://groupietrackers.herokuapp.com/api)
    Basic understanding of web development and RESTful services

#### Running the Application

    1. Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/karodgers/melodic-meetups.git
    
    cd melodic-meetups

    2. Set up and run the Go server:

    go run main.go

    3. Open the website in your browser at http://localhost:9090.

## üìã Future Improvements

Here are some enhancements that could be added in future iterations:

    1. Pagination: Implement pagination for large datasets like concert locations or artist lists.
    2. Artist Collaboration Map: Add a feature to display collaborations or shared concert locations between different artists.
    3. User Authentication: Allow users to sign in and save favorite artists or concerts for personalized experiences.
    4. Advanced Filtering: Introduce more granular filtering options, such as filtering by genre, country, or time period.
